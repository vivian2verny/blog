                    Mobile banking has become a financial game-changer in the
                    African continent. The idea has played a significant role in
                    revolutionising the way financial transactions are
                    conducted. It s no secret that there is limited banking in
                    some African regions. Still, Africa has embraced mobile
                    money as a powerful tool to bridge the financial inclusion
                    gap and drive economic growth.

                    Although poor financial inclusion is not only a problem in
                    Africa, it is a challenge that has lasted a long time, with
                    a significant portion of the population needing more access
                    to banking services. However, the ubiquity of mobile phones
                    has provided an opportunity to overcome this challenge.
                    Africans may avoid banking like the plague but love their
                    smartphones and the global access it gives them.
